# Integration-Chat
A simple multi-user chat system - InteChat! Welcome!

    # Purpose
    InteChat is a multi-user chat system! Secure, fast and reliable
    Users will be able to chat with eachother, and groups they create

Our rules:
    -   Project will be split to the Client side and the Server side
    -   Every Python file will be a class (meaning only 1 class in each file - for good practice)
    -   Users can register and login to their existing user
    -   Unique usernames (Not passwords since that could imply someone's using that password - faster to bruteforce)
    -   Passwords safely stored
    -   Chats are saved and logged
    -   Messages include Date&Time + username
